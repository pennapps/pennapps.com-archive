      "site": "MedCity News",
      "description": " Apple‚Äôs watch dominated headlines last¬† week. At the PennApps hackathon over the weekend, one team demonstrated that healthcare applications arising from wearable hacks can excite interest. The healthcare apps, wearables and devices developed in the technology laboratory through a national gathering of university students yielded some interesting takes on how to motivate and produce healthier behavior. Some used what seemed like punishment techniques to change behavior. Others used technology from sponsors such as IBM, Intel, Jawbone and others to go beyond the expected. As hackathons go, few teams produce technology that will become the heart of a company. But they often highlight the potential healthcare applications from the companies producing the building blocks of mobile and Web-based apps. Watch My Step used technology based on a Pebble watch to move beyond the wearable popularized by Life Alert decades ago. In this case, it offered a setting on the watch that transmits an alert to caregivers when the owner falls. It also gave a 10 second countdown for users to click yes or no on whether they could get up after the fall. Geolocation is a big part of the app. It relies on Google Map‚Äôs API to inform caretakers of where the fall took place. The team received a $500 prize from Epic, Body Sense The team sought to move beyond concussion detectors and highlight hard hits to other parts of the body, particularly the torso through a shirt embedded with sensors. A member of the team had a wearable pad that resembled plastic body armor. Whenever someone touched his chest, it triggered a light lit up. The idea, said one team member, is to make the sensors sensitive enough so that it recognizes the difference between a moderate and heavy hit. The team‚Äôs focus emerged from conversations with med school students that many sports injuries are misdiagnosed because doctors are not informed of where the force of impact took place. Scolio It seems like we‚Äôre establishing a certain comfort level with pre-diagnosis apps. They capture the urgency and emotion of a warning of a potential medical condition with the comfort zone of not making any claims of medical accuracy. Scolio take another step in that direction with a platform to encourage earlier intervention for scoliosis, a condition that involves a curvature of the spine. The team developed an app that evaluates posture and uses a set of metric that compares the position of the hips with the shoulders. It also factors in back pain, headaches and leg pain. Although it is not designed to diagnose scoliosis, it is intended to alert people to the symptoms in the hopes they‚Äôll seek medical help. Quitli Maybe it was an inevitable ‚Äî a wearable that highlights bad health and fitness habits. It‚Äôs a cross between a nagging parent and drill sergeant. A team that pitched its wearable as a ‚ÄúFitbit for sh*t you‚Äôd like to quit,‚Äù developed the device to record when users smoke, crack their knuckles, use an elevator rather than stairs, and are too sedentary. The device uses accelerometrics to spot less than stellar health and fitness practices ‚Äî it even is designed to notify users when they slouch or stay up too late. It also notes when users shop at a store they have blacklisted. Although on judge suggested it‚Äôs like asking users to hang a scarlet letter around their necks, much of the discipline is self directed. The company came in third place overall in the app tournament. FitFactor was another team that used a mix of positive and negative consequences for reaching daily fitness goals (or failing to reach them). Users enter their favorite entertainment websites such as Netflix or Facebook and access to them is blocked until they have achieved their goals. Third Eye developed a way to use Google Glass to help some of the estimated 7 million who are legally blind give an audio read of what‚Äôs in front of them. For example, it could distinguish between a dollar bill and a $20 bill. The idea is to make people more independent. ",

      "site": "MedCity News",
      "description": "A nationwide hackathon hosted by University of Pennsylvania this weekend added a new wrinkle with a mobile health division, PennApps Health. The move underscores the growth of mhealth submissions in the contest and the interest in shaping app development with clinical insights. Companies such as Independence Blue Cross, Main Line Health, and interestingly, electronic medical record giant, Epic, set down some guidance on the kinds of tools they‚Äôre looking for, which corresponded with national trends. Staff from the Perelman School of Medicine, Penn Center for Innovation and University of Pennsylvania Health System are participating in the hackathon both as mentors and as hackers. Penn medical school student Mitt Coats organized PennApps Health. Among the tools they‚Äôre looking for are ways to improve healthcare literacy, and make it easier for patients to manage their health once they‚Äôre discharged. Independence Blue Cross is looking for apps that fit into categories such as doctor visit assistants that could help with referrals and to manage customers‚Äô personal health records and drug interaction alerts. Other needs on its radar include a way for adult children to remotely monitor their parents and medication adherence. It is offering a prize of Apple Watches to up to four members of a team when the devices come on the market. Dan Velazquez, who works in Epic‚Äôs research and development division at its Verona, Wisconsin headquarters, said it would give an award for best patient engagement app. DreamIt Ventures is also offering a prize ‚Äî a final round interview for its 2015 class in Baltimore or Philadelphia. Among the prizes on offer across the PennApps hackathon include one from Thalmic Labs for the best hack using its API for its gesture control wearable Myo. BenefitFocus is giving FitBits for the best healthcare hack. Winners are to be announced Sunday afternoon. Check back here for an update on the winning healthcare teams. [Photo from Flickr] ",

As event sponsors, we wanted to help throw the best hackathon ever. So we transformed a classroom into REDlounge: a pimped out, go-to spot for bleary eyed coders to crash on bean bag chairs, grab free swag and snacks, unwind with arcade games, or get advice from our expert PennApps mentors. We also had the opportunity to select a winner for Most Useful Everyday App, which carried a cool $1,500 prize. We talked to lots of talented innovators working on impressive projects, and everyone who participated deserves a high five. It was a tough decision, but because we're a bunch of travel junkies (and Beatles fans!) Day Tripper made the biggest impression on us and took home the prize. Way to go, guys!
